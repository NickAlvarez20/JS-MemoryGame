## Project Name
JS-MemoryGame
## About
A web-based memory game that displays a sequence of random digits on the screen for the player to memorize. After the sequence is hidden, the player enters the recalled number via an input field. The game tracks correct and incorrect answers, allowing players to continue generating and attempting new sequences.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need JavaScript installed on your system.
No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This JS-MemoryGame includes these features:

-Random generation of numerical sequences based on selected difficulty.

-User input field for entering memorized sequences with validation against the generated number.

-Score tracking for correct and incorrect answers.

-Reset functionality to clear scores and restart.

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/JS-MemoryGame.git`
## Usage
Open the index.html file in a web browser. Select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) or use the default Generate Numbers button to display a sequence. 

Click "Ready?" to hide the sequence and show the input field, then enter the number and click "Check Answer" for feedback.
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Implement JavaScript functions for random number generation and array manipulation.

-Handle DOM elements, event listeners, and user input validation in a browser environment.

-Apply CSS for layout, styling, and background imagery to enhance user interface.
